# About Me

I've been climbing for a year.

Mu's question: Where do you usually go for climbing, the climbing wall at Rec?

Mario's question: Do you enjoy any other recreational activities?

$\textit{Sarah's Response: Yep, I usually go to the Rec Cen. I did badminton in high school, but wasn't very good at it.}$
